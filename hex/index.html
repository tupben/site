This is the game of Hex aka Nash. It was not invented by John Nash, but Nash was way more popular Piet Hein, so that's why we don't call it Hein.

To play: Players take turns placing a tile of their color on one of the hexes. Each tries to create an uninterrupted path from one side of the board to the other. Red tries to connect right to left; Blue tries to connect top to bottom.

Question: If both players play perfectly, will either win? If so, who? What is perfect strategy? For a nice proof answering this questions, check out <a href="http://www.cut-the-knot.org/Curriculum/Games/HexTheory.shtml">this article</a>.
