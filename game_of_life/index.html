The Game of Life is a simulation that creates beautiful life-like populations with very simple rules. Each node is either dead or alive, and each turn it asks itself 2 questions:

		Am I alive?
			Yes: 	How many living neighbors do I have?
												2 or 3:	STAY ALIVE
											not	2 or 3: 	DIE
			No:		How many living neighbors do I have?
													3: 	COME ALIVE
												not	3: 	STAY DEAD

There are some wonderful natural patterns that pop up under these rules. Some groups are stable - they won't change unless bothered. Can you can find the smallest stable group? Can you find the largest stable group? Can you make a group that oscillates between 2 or more states, but returns to its starting value?

EDIT: It's 2022 and I've recently returned to this project (which I made in 2017) to add some pizazz. Some new modifications allow you to control the parameters of the game:

<b>Birth conditions</b> and <b>Life conditions</b> describe how many neighbors a cell must have to be born and to stay alive. The default for these two is 3 and 2,3 (respectively) but different conditions yield different population behaviors.

The <b>Neighborhood radius</b> is how many nearby cells to check to satisfy the above conditions. Traditionally, the neighborhood of a cell is its 8 adjacent cells, but this parameter allows you to change the radius of that neighborhood.

<b>Spontaneity</b> is the probability that a dead cell comes to life spontaneously, regardless of its neighboring conditions. This is not traditionally part of the Game of Life, but I thought it was a cool to see life form ex nihilo. Try something really small like 0.005, crank the speed up, and watch for life.

The <b>Save</b> button will export a .txt file containing a list of lists of lists, that is [[[0,1],...],...] describing the history of all states that have been run since the last Clear. I have some code posted on github that can be viewed <a href="https://nbviewer.org/github/tupben/sage-notebooks/blob/main/Game%20of%20Life.ipynb">here</a>. This code allows you to graph a game of life session using Sage Math.

Finally, I've changed the topology so that the game is played on a torus rather than a square. This means that a Glider leaving out of the top will come back up from the bottom, rather than collapsing on a wall or disappearing.
