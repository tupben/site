The Game of Life is a simulation that creates beautiful life-like populations with very simple rules. Each node is either dead or alive and each turn it asks it self 2 questions:

		Am I alive?
			Yes: 	How many living neighbors do I have?
														3: 	STAY ALIVE
													not	3:	DIE
			No:		How many living neighbors do I have?
													2 or 3: 	COME ALIVE
												not	2 or 3: 	STAY DEAD

There are some wonderful natural patterns that pop up under these rules. Some groups are stable - they won't change unless 'bothered'. Can you can find the smallest stable group? Can you find the largest stable group? Can you make a group that oscilates between 2 or more states, but returns to its starting value?

I implemented this using D3. An underlying array is holding the values for each node. The D3 data-join is creating and updating the elements as the data change.
