This is my rendering of the Mandelbrot fractal.

This is a visualizer for one of the key concepts of linear algebra: the transformation. In 2-space, a transformation can be described by a 2x2 matrix. To understand how this matrix will transform our space (or any vector within it), take a look at the red and green 'basis' vectors above. Each one has a name:

					red   	=> 		&#x00EE;	=>		say 'i hat'
					green 	=> 		&#x0135;	=>		say 'j hat'

You may have done matrix multiplication in school. First row times first column, first row times second column, etc. Here's the intuition. 

  <strong><small>The 1st column of the transformation matrix tells the red &#x00EE; vector where to go.</small>
  <small>The 2nd column of the transformation matrix tells the green &#x0135; vector where to go.</small></strong>

Now clear whatever you've been futzing around on with the "Restart!" button. Enter the example matrix above and press "Transform!"

							-1 , 0 , 1 , 1

&#x00EE; ends up at (-1,0) while &#x0135; ends up at (1,1). Neat, huh? Play around with it for a bit. See if you can define a rotation, a reflection, or a "skew". The nice thing about linear algebra transformations, thus defined, is that they pack a big punch. How nice to be able to describe a specific stretch, turn, and skew with just 4 numbers!

If you're new to linear algebra (like I am), I recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZK3O402wf1c">Professor Gilbert Strang's</a> lecture series and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjBOesZCoqc&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=1">this introductory series</a> by 3Blue1Brown.

P.S. You can look in the .html file below to find some of the preset transformations. I'll give you the chance to figure them out yourself first, but if you get impatient go to ~line 150.
