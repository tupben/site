Inspired by other music viusalizers (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ykTqoQnqI">here</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yojDu3E9jls&index=7&list=RD--ykTqoQnqI">here</a>), I built this chord visualizer using D3. As the song plays, the chords pass across the screen. This could be useful for ear-training or learning to play a new song.

The button on the left toggles the arrangement of chords between "steps" and "5ths. The former arranges chords in sequential order: C,D,E,F,G. The latter arranges the chords by 5ths. In music theory, chords that are 5 steps (inclusive) away from each other (i.e. C and G, or D and A) are considered more relevent to each other than simply adjacent chords.

The button on the right toggles the names of the chords. Chords an be refered to either by their chord name (i.e. C, F, G) or their scale number (i.e. 1, 4, 5).

The chords are hard-coded in - no complicated audio processing here. Additionally, I set the tempo with a BPM value. This makes this visualizer only equipped to handle songs recorded to a metronome.

Here is Justin Timberlake's "Mirrors" from the eponymous album.
